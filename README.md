this project is an informational website for an imaginary restaurant called **apicius cafe**.
all DOM elements are dynamically created, deleted, and updated with javascript as the visitor 
interacts with the website.

i used css to create the ancient rome-inspired theme; one standout feature is the repeating mosaic background behind the nav bar, which is realized with a `::before` pseudo-element.
